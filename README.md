# Exploring Atlanta Open Data Portal

This repo is just some noodling around with data from the Atlanta Open Data Hub: https://gis.atlantaga.gov/?page=OPEN-DATA-HUB

Atlanta has a long history of voting down expansions to public transit. I wanted to look at the publicly available data and see what it says about the gap between the current public transit options and the city's needs. 

Some other things to look into:
- Are schools public transit accessible?
- Are hospitals public transit accessible?
- What areas might benefit most from transit expansion?
